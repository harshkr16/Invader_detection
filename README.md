# wifi_rssi_phonecall
This is a project designed to identify any suspicious person at the place where they are not supposed to be for ex. detecting a thief inside house say near almirah or something. So, when they arrive at this place and if stay there for more than 5 seconds then a phone call is initiated to the owner stating someone's presence.
It works on wifi signal strength or RSSI(Recieved Signal Stength Indicator) in which wifi router acts as a signal transmitter and Esp32 acts as a signal reciever and when the person comes near to the reciever, signal strength varies and when it goes below certain set threshold, it initiates a phonecall and hence ensures safety.
